# std::cout is out, why iostreams must go

The slides to the talk I gave at the [Berlin C++ Meetup on Nov 17 2015](http://www.meetup.com/de/berlincplusplus/events/226478618/).

Folder `slides` contains the slides as an HTML file. [Open the file in your browser and hit 'P' to see the presenter notes](https://cdn.rawgit.com/stheophil/iostreams_talk/master/slides/platform_io.html#1). I've used [remark.js](http://remarkjs.com) to create the slides. 

Folder `benchmark` contains the source code with a small (entirely non-scientific) I/O benchmark I made. It compares the performance of `std::iostreams`, `std::FILE*` and raw I/O using file handles in three scenarios: Writing chunks of 1M at a time, writing a single character at a time and formatted output with a few more characters at a time. I've used the excellent [nonius benchmarking framwork](https://nonius.io) for the actual measurements. Compile the source with
